Hey! I'm a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) in Bangalore, working with the [M365 Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/) team.

I am interested in desigining principled **reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithms that can solve complex sequential-decision making problems. At Microsoft, my research spans systems like Microsoft Teams and Azure. 

My current focus is on offline RL and challenges such as adapting policies to distribution shifts and non-stationarity in the environment. I am also very interested in exploring unsupervised RL, since the idea of training generalist policies that can adapt to diverse downstream tasks seems very exciting to me.

Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research, where I developed intelligent decision-making frameworks for improving sustainability in datacenters by optimizing CPU power consumption.

Before joining Microsoft, I did my bachelors in electrical engineering at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

**I am applying to PhD programs to start in Fall 2025!**
