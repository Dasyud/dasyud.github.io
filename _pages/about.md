I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) in Bangalore, India, and work as a member of the [M365 Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/) team.

I employ reinforcement learning (RL) for complex sequential decision making problems in various systems, such as Microsoft Teams (RTC) and Azure, and solve the research challenges involved.

I am currently dealing with offline reinforcement learning, focusing on the challenges pertaining to the deployment of policies, such as adapting to distribution shifts and non-stationarity in the environment.

I am also very interested in exploring unsupervised RL and understanding how they can be used to train generalist policies that can adapt to any downstream task.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), supervised by [Dr. Mayukh Das](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mayukhdas/) at the [M365 Research group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/). I worked on intelligent decision-making frameworks for improving Sustainability in Datacenters, focusing on reducing Scope 2 Emissions by reducing CPU power consumption without violating workload requirements.

Before joining Microsoft, I did my bachelors at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

**I will be applying to PhD programs to start in Fall 2025!**
