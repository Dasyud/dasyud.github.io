I am a predoctoral researcher in the [M365 Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/) team at Microsoft.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I graduated from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/), with a Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering.

My work broadly deals with Reinforcement Learning for sequential decision making in various systems. My interests also lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Information Theory, and in Geometric Deep Learning.

I was previously a Research Intern at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), supervised by [Dr. Mayukh Das](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mayukhdas/) at the [M365 Research group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-innovation/). I worked on AI-based decision-making frameworks for Sustainability in Datacenters, focusing on reducing Scope 2 Emissions by reducing CPU power consumption without violating workload requirements.

In a not-too-distant past, I worked with [Dr. Tzyy-Ping Jung](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~jung/) from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) on detecting students' stress from EEG data using Graph Machine Learning. I worked closely with the lab's Microsoft Research (Redmond) collaborators during this project.
