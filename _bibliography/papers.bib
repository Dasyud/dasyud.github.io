      abstract={The difficulty of exploring and training online on real production systems limits the scope of real-time online data/feedback-driven decision making. The most feasible approach is to adopt offline reinforcement learning from limited trajectory samples. However, after deployment, such policies fail due to exogenous factors that temporarily or permanently disturb/alter the transition distribution of the assumed decision process structure induced by offline samples. This results in critical policy failures and generalization errors in sensitive domains like Real-Time Communication (RTC). We solve this crucial problem of identifying robust actions in presence of domain shifts due to unseen exogenous stochastic factors in the wild. As it is impossible to learn generalized offline policies within the support of offline data that are robust to these unseen exogenous disturbances, we propose a novel post-deployment shaping of policies (Streetwise), conditioned on real-time characterization of out-of-distribution sub-spaces. This leads to robust actions in bandwidth estimation (BWE) of network bottlenecks in RTC and in standard benchmarks. Our extensive experimental results on BWE and other standard offline RL benchmark environments demonstrate a significant improvement (â‰ˆ 18% on some scenarios) in final returns wrt. end-user metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Overclocking computing nodes in datacenters is emerging as an area of great interest since it presents an opportunity to temporarily boost performance and handle transient demand surges more cost-effectively for cloud providers. However, indiscriminate overclocking increases risks like power capping events that negate performance gains, accelerated component wear, and power consumption spikes. This work proposes an intelligent overclocking orchestration framework that employs a holistic system continuously monitoring workload characteristics, resource utilization, and power telemetry across the infrastructure. It leverages advanced modeling techniques to anticipate demand and optimize overclocking decisions based on performance benefits and mitigation of associated risks through adaptive policies. Preliminary evaluations on production cloud workload traces demonstrate the efficacy of the intelligent overclocking system in reducing power capping incidents by up to 100 times compared to naive approaches. Furthermore, the work outlines ongoing research directions, including the application of reinforcement learning techniques to derive globally optimal overclocking policies while incorporating fairness and reliability objectives, and seamless extensibility to emerging accelerator technologies.},
